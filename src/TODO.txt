AI
===
Pre-record movement nodes every X amount of seconds.
AI will move towards those nodes as best they can. If they get stuck for some amount of time, attempt moving forward with next nodes. (Give them like 5 extra seconds per node than intended)
Record each collection of a powerup/launch moment as these are important nodes for AI to be on. (Maybe "Cheat" the AI a little if thier stuck node counte i really high by teleporting them when they are off-screen)


Important Events:

Powerup Collection
Jet Launch
Tunnel Enter
New Tile Traversal

Be careful about changing maps as AI must then be re-recorded!!!


LORE
===================

(?) discovered a strange floating energy orb while going for their morning run. Curious, they approached it and came into contact with it, granting them new powers.

Excited by this discovery (?) decided to share it with the rest of their hamster friends.

A couple villain/scientist hamsters realize that this has become a stubby legs race with great potential and recruited world class hamsters to run and obtain these new orbs for research.


Stage II - Branching

Stage III - Swamp/Ice

Stage IV - Hamster Jet



Hamsters are experimenting with new technologies to emphasize their running capabilities beyond what was originally thought possible.



Hamsters from all around Hamster planet have been recruited to scavenge for
