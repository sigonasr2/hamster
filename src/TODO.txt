AI
===
Pre-record movement nodes every X amount of seconds.
AI will move towards those nodes as best they can. If they get stuck for some amount of time, attempt moving forward with next nodes. (Give them like 5 extra seconds per node than intended)
Record each collection of a powerup/launch moment as these are important nodes for AI to be on. (Maybe "Cheat" the AI a little if thier stuck node counte i really high by teleporting them when they are off-screen)


Important Events:

Powerup Collection
Jet Launch
Tunnel Enter
New Tile Traversal

Be careful about changing maps as AI must then be re-recorded!!!
